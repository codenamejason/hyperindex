Getting Started

`npm install --global float-indexer`

`float-indexer init`

options pass in etherscan api and generate abis/config.yaml

1. abi
2. define events and schema
3. How do handlers look

Notes/Considerations:

How many contracts and events could the combined query filter take before breaking?
How do we handle common function signatures between contracts?
